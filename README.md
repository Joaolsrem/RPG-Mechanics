# RPG-Mechanics

 This RPG is a prototype game. I recreated some mechanics from some games that I really like and added some things that I felt like adding.

Mechanics and systems in the game:

- Food system
Every certain time, the food bar will decrease a little, when it reaches zero, you will start to lose life.

- Eating system
There are 2 types of food in my game, "Bad" food and "Good" food. If you are hungry in the game and have any of these foods and decide to eat the bad food, you will suffer consequences, you will lose some hp, but at least you will recover some of your hunger bar, But if you are smart and choose the "Good" food your hunger bar will increase more than it would if it was the "Bad" food and you will not suffer any consequences if you decide to eat "Good" food

- Fireball system

Every 15 seconds, if you hold down the K key for 3 seconds the power bar will go to zero instantly and a fireball will spawn that goes in a straight direction. Remember that the enemy also releases a fireball, if he doesn't reach you, he will stop and release a fireball at you

- Shield system
You can defend yourself from the Enemy's attacks, but you cannot defend yourself from his fireball. When the defense bar runs out, you will not be able to defend yourself, but it will start to recover, then you will be able to defend yourself.

There are a lot of things, you can look at the videos, ok? Thanks
